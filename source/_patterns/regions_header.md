type: Regions
scss: _content_accordion.scss
usage: "Accordion folds can be a handy way of organizing bits of content on a page."

donts: "

- Don't use folds to tuck away content you'd rather not look at. Clearer, concise writing or making hard editing choices will be a better choice.

- There is no way to direct link to a fold that is not open, so do not hide content behind a tab that you expect to be easy to find.

"
dos: "

- Pay particular attention to the role attributes and aria-controls in these examples. They make your content more accessible.

"
shortcode: "[collapsibles][collapse title=\"Collapse 1\" active=\"true\"]Collapse stuff in the first accordion fold.[/collapse]"
