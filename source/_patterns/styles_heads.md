usage: "All HTML headings, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> through <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, are available. Structure your writing in sections, with cascading headline hierarchy. This will make your writing easier to scan, as well as make it more accessible and search engine friendly."

dos: "

- Use headlines to define and structure your content.

- Begin at a high-level headline, like `h1`. Define subsections with lower-level headlines.

"
donts: "

- Don't use headlines to create emphasis. Headlines should serve as a heading of the content that follows, not a way of making text bigger.
