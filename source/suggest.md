## Component Guidelines


### Components should be reusable and flexible.

Is your request overly specific? When adding features to the templates, we must make sure they will be useful in many different contexts. If the feature you require is overly specific, it may be best implemented only for your site and not included in the university-wide templates.

### Components should reflect the UT style guide and brand.

While user interface elements are generally functional, they should visually meet the university's [brand guidelines](https://brand.utk.edu).

### Components should be accessible.

All components should meet the university's [accessibility](../accessibility) guidelines.

### Components should be expansive

Our websites appear on small screens that fit in the palm of your hand, as well as large high-resolution desktop displays. They are also interacted with using a variety of input devices (touch screens, mice, keyboards, etc). How will the feature you are requesting function and appear in all these contexts?

### Components should be lightweight.

How much additional code and maintenance will your feature require? Does it require a lot of javascript or complex CSS?

### Have you already built the component?

If you have a pattern you have built that you feel would benefit the university community, please indicate this and provide a link to an example.
