# University of Tennessee, Knoxville Design System WordPress Theme

## Requirements

- npm [npm Docs: Installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
- Node.js 14 (using a [Node version manager](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-node-js-and-npm) is highly recommended)
- Gulp 4.0.2 (will install as a dependency)
- [The UT Design System Framework](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/utkds-framework)

It is recommended that the design framework project be placed **in the same directory** as this project, since they share resources.

To test/develop this project locally, install WordPress, and create symlink to `build` in this directory to use as your theme.

## Installing this project

1. make sure you are running Node.js 14 prior to install
2. run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Recommended development configuration

It is recommended that the design framework project be placed **in the same directory** as this project, since they share resources.

To test or develop this project locally, install WordPress, but do not install this theme. Instead, create symlink to the `build` directory in this project and place that symlink in your WordPress installation's theme directory.

## Gulp Task Runner

- Requires the [design system](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/design-system-build-files) to be placed in the same directory as this project.
- `gulp build` will build a testing theme.
- `gulp dist` will minimize all images and css and javascript for production.

**Note**: The JS and CSS is edited in the design system project. This gulp project pulls in JS and CSS partials from that.

## Updates and Changes

The design system style sheet is built by [the design system repo](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/utkds-framework).

The documentation site is a static site generated by Jekyll. The repo of the documentation site is [The Hill Docs](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/thehill-docs).

## Notes

Neither `/build/` nor `/dist/` directories are represented in this repo (they are ignored). They should be generated with `gulp build` and `gulp dist`.

This theme does not currently have any styles or javascript associated with it. It pulls an external 'design system' [stylesheet](http://images.utk.edu/designsystem/2020/assets/css/style.css) and [script](http://images.utk.edu/designsystem/2020/assets/js/utk.js) located on the images server. These file are generated by the [framework project](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/utkds-framework).
