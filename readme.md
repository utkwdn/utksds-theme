# The Design System WordPress Theme

This theme does not currently have any styles or javascript associated with it. It pulls an external 'design system' [stylesheet](http://images.utk.edu/designsystem/2020/assets/css/style.css) and [script](http://images.utk.edu/designsystem/2020/assets/js/utk.js) located on the images server.

## Documentation

[notthehill.utk.edu](https://notthehill.utk.edu)

## Gulp Task Runner

- Requires Gulp4 and Node 12.
- Only edit files in `/src/`
- `gulp build` will build a testing theme.
- `gulp dist` will minimize all images and css and javascript for production.

**Note**: Because the design system's JS and CSS is compiled in the design system project.

## Updates and Changes

The design system style sheet is build by [the design system repo](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/design-system-build-files).

The documentation site is a static site generated by Jekyll. The repo of the documentation site is [The Hill Docs](https://github.utk.edu/ocm/thehill-docs).

## Notes

Neither `/build/` nor `/dist/` directories are represented in this repo (they are ignored). They should be generated with `gulp build` and `gulp dist`.
